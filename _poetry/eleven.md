i was remembering <br>
that house in the desert <br>
with steel girders clutching hot glass <br>
<br>
shuddering at night <br>
like ribs failing to draw a breath. <br>
<br>
brilliantly in-<br>
<br>
vis<br>
-i-<br>
ble<br>
<br>
and alone and<br>
held by hills of<br>
gritted boulders. i was thinking<br>
<br>
of how we climbed those<br> 
honeycombed rocks<br>
<br>
(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br> 
serrations)<br>
<br>
and squinted at tempered<br> 
shimmers,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when your name resurfaced<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on<br>
my phone. it shook<br>
<br>
like the<br>
<br>
tender tremors of an ailing cat<br>
