_for G.T._<br>
<br>
_I want you to scream_, you said. We were part<br>
of a mingling Bushwick rabble, all spread<br>

under the tiki bar’s red lights. _Right now,_<br>
you said, and my face became hot like a slice<br>

of Bee Sting doused in chili oil. A silent countdown<br>
and a garble dragged out, a breathless<br>

shriek. The muscles in my lungs made raw<br>
from the abrasion. It sounded like a hatchling bird<br>

whining from the nest, and it was so weak<br>
that almost nobody turned. I felt shame<br>

and excitement. _See?_ you said.<br>
I did — something cleansing about the burn,<br>

how it revealed the tenderness underneath.
The cry speaking up for something inside, stifled.<br> 

Listen. That night, I began to take heed<br>
of the hunger.<br>
