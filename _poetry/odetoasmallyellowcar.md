How far your little tires brought us! <br>
Over the snow of Hobart <br>
Over the Catskills twigs & leaves. <br>
Over the broken concrete of New York. <br>
<br>
You had no business <br>
making the trips you did, <br>
but you did <br>
for us. <br>
<br>
Inside your <br>
lemonade frame, <br>
a sweet and lovely girl. <br>
<br>
How it made my day when I saw you rolling down the street. <br>
How my days would end watching you zoom away. <br>
<br>
Our flame <br>
was so bright <br>
inside you. <br>
<br>
Your trunk was small <br>
but always enough to carry our dreams. <br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Thereâ€™s a piece of my heart<br>
Somewhere, between the seats<br>
Next to a honey bbq twist.<br>
