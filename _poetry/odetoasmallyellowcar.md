How far your little tires brought us!
Over the snow of Hobart
Over the Catskills twigs & leaves. 
Over the broken concrete of New York.

You had no business
making the trips you did,
but you did
for us.

Inside your 
lemonade frame,
a sweet and lovely girl.

How it made my day when I saw you rolling down the street.
How my days would end watching you zoom away.

Our flame
was so bright
inside you.

Your trunk was small
but always enough to carry our dreams.
Thank you.

Thereâ€™s a piece of my heart
Somewhere, between the seats
Next to a honey bbq twist.
