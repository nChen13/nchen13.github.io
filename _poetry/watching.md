The planes have never flown this close <br>
grazing the leaves of my forgotten plants. <br>
This room keeps a sliver of mossy acres. <br>
From the sills of the skies I bear witness <br>
to buildings in the distance crowned by clouds. <br>
The birds resemble constellations <br>
Iâ€™ve seen layered in the folds of a dress. <br>
On this day the rumbling of the subway <br>
echoes through my charcoal caverns. The ones <br> 
burrowed hand-in-hand. <br>
Gazing upwards, I wonder <br>
if this plane is the one that cradles you. <br>
