My new dentist has a TV on the ceiling <br>
affixed right above the chair. One loose screw <br>
and it smashes through your pearly whites. <br>
She reclines my seat. The screen lights up. <br>
I’m transfixed by the circular mirror next <br>
to my mouth. There’s a sparse desert landscape <br>
dotted with black trees bereft of branches. <br>
I turn back to the screen when I realize <br>
it’s just my chin. There’s a leopard staring at me. <br>
My dentist leans in to speak. I contemplate two <br>
sets of green eyes. The leopard begins to snarl. <br>
<br>
The young antelope falls exhausted after <br>
the chase. The leopard doesn’t pounce or <br>
ravish the hard-earned prize. Just gently holds <br>
the antelope in place, fangs pressed against <br>
the soft hide. My seat lifts up. The dentist <br>
shows me an x-ray. One tooth separated <br>
from the pack. _Just let it be_, I want to say. <br>
