The Lego figure was so puny against my palm.<br>
Sliding on the callouses. These are my hands?<br>
<br>
They couldn’t be the same ones that built castles<br>
perched atop couches. (How they towered over me<br>
<br>
on the rug.) The same busted thumbs that betrayed<br>
every dribble. Loved to sprain against pebbled leather.<br>
<br>
Fingers that couldn’t tie laces but could still collar tie,<br> 
wrapped up the ocky way. Those same digits that filled<br>
<br>
mittens that swung the refrigerator wide open, and pulled<br>
back, heels rocking, the groan of a sinking ship shifting<br>
<br>
two degrees away from crushing a boy with Le Creuset<br>
and blueberry cartons. They were in the diner, gripping<br>
<br>
Rick’s right hand and twisting for a bite of bread pudding.<br>
Him demanding to see the left after. One empty saucer<br>
<br>
and an unfinished job. Such big, clumsy hands<br>
searching through these little plastic pieces.<br>
