I nosedived from circadian cliffs and belly-flopped<br>
into my viscera. Looking around my heart,<br>
the walls were lined with plaques — accolades abound!<br> 
<br>
Someone had carved into the scar tissue, “MAYA<br> 
IS HERE.” Maybe I’m due for a trip to Statin Island, where<br>
nobody wants to go, but they will: to glimpse freedom.<br>
<br>
The blood rushed until I was holding up my crown.<br>
If every follicle is sacred why are my temples exposed?<br> 
Each white hair is a sugar straw stuck in a salt lick.<br>
<br>
I wake to find my baby pictures lying on my chest,<br>
as if they drifted off to my heartbeat, and not the sobs,<br>
listening to me murmur, *oh god, what have I done to you.*<br>
